I rule, you rule, we all rule old-school Hyrule, a 2012 7DRL by Trystan Spangler

Prove that you are fit to rule Hyrule by defeating all other contenders while surviving the attacks of goblin clans, randomized monsters, and the natural denizens of the land. Optional minibosses hide within the randomly generated overwold and protect swords, bombs, arrows, armor, magic books, and other items. The catch is, you can only carry two items at a time and using them will cost rupees.

Some monster traits you may encounter:
 Evasive monsters are much better at avoiding your attacks.
 Social monsters will call for help if they feel threatened.
 Camouflaged monsters can only be seen when they are close to you.

Some items you may find along the way:
 A bow that cost one rupee to shoot arrows with.
 A ring of regeneration that passively recovers lost hearts.
 An advanced spellbook that lets you unleash magic missiles, summon an imp, and mutate yourself.
 A staff that gives you a chance to perry melee attacks and get a free attack when someone attacks you.
