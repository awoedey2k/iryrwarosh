I rule, you rule, we all rule old-school Hyrule, a 2012 7DRL by Trystan Spangler

Prove that you are fit to rule Hyrule by defeating all other contenders while surviving the attacks of goblin clans, randomized monsters, and the natural denizens of the land. Use swords, bombs, arrows, armor, magic books, and other items found in the randomly generated overworld. The catch is, you can only carry two at a time and some cost rupees, or even hearts, to use.
